## What?
This is a document that will record all the things I have learned (and will learn) in this trajectory.

## Why?
After a lot of unaccepted submissions, I learned to search for better solutions. "And here it comes": code optimization, best pratiques...
Trying to keep this in my mind, I decided to write that, and here I am.

# Okay, content now.

## Time
Some things can be done in several ways, we know that. But, when you're programming and need to run some code with a time limit, it's not that simple.
With time limitations I learned:
  - "Scanner" is cool, but "BufferedReader" can do it faster;
  - "sout" looks faster, but "BufferedWriter" will do it faster;
  - Strings are imutable (WTF? Whenever you change the content of a "String", in fact a new "String" is created with the new content, because the previous one cannot be changed);
  - If you want to build String content during execution, use StringBuilder (the name makes sense, doesn't it?)
